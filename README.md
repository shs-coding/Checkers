# Checkers

This is by far the hardest project I've ever attempted, and I'm very happy with how it turned out.

This project utilizes PyGame and is built in Python 3.6.

To use, download all files, unzip the folder and name it "CheckersPython", and place it into 'Downloads'. At the end it should look like this -- C:\Users\(yourname)\Downloads\CheckersPython.

Open the .py file in your program of choice.
