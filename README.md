# Checkers

This is by far the hardest project I've ever attempted, and I'm very happy with how it turned out.

This project utilizes PyGame and is built in Python 3.6.

To use, download the entire folder, name it "CheckersPython", and place it into 'Downloads' -- C:\Users\(yourname)\Downloads\CheckersPython.
Open the .py file in your program of choice.
